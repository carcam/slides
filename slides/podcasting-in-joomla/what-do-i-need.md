## What do I need?

Note:
* Hardware and software are not important
* It's actually like any other project in your life: You need to write down your "project plan":
	* Write down your goals: What do you want to achieve?
	* Either if you are succesful or not, you are creating a community, so think about your "vision" on this: What do you want your podcast to be?
	* Think about the tone of your podcast
	* Think about your programs structure:
		* It makes it easier for you to write down your scripts
		* People need to feel save and having the same structure repeated all over will make them engage more
	* Periodicity is important. Choose if you are doing it daily, weekly, monthly... or even just ocasionally!! But make it clear so that your audience knows what to expect
	* Think a list of possible topics for your podcast
