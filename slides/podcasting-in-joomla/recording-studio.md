## Recording in Studio

Note: 
* You need a quite and more or less isolated room
* A great variety of microphones in a great range of prices
* If you are starting and cannot have a quite room: Dynamic Microphone
* If you want a better frecuency response you need to go to a capacitor microphone
	* Cardiode range
	* Check it has a good amplitude
	* I use Behringer C1U
	* People recommend Samson q2u for beginners, but it's hard to get outside of the States
	* For today I bought a Tonor dual microphone which I have seen to work fine. But I'm not an audio freak
