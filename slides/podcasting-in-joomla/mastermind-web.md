## The basics of Mastermind Joomla! Web

<img  src="images/mastermind.png" />
Note:
* Using my forked version of Podcast Manager for audios
* The simplest design I could find
* Really focused on Mobile experience and simplicity
* Comments with CComments: Lots of room for improvement
* Using Joomla! Custom Fields:
	* Sergio Iglesias contributed with ivoox custom field
* Using Easy Layouts to adjust look and feel
* Improving the website on each "project of the week" so that my listeners can also feel engaged to it
