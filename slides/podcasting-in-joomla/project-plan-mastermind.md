Note:
* Goals:
	* WP in Spain is much more popular than Joomla! and I think it's because most Marketing companies speak and promote WP for free in Blogs, Podcasts, YouTube... We need to change that state. We need to speak more and louder about Joomla! because it's better than many other platforms people are promoting for free!!
	* I had the idea of starting a Joomla! Courses Membership site. And I thougth this was a perfect medium for promoting it
	* Get also some extra money from advertising
* Vision:
	* To push Joomla! Community forward for all Spanish Speakers and try to reunite them
	* Not just to "teach" and promote Joomla! but also to keep learning and growing alltogether as a whole
	* Out of my confort zone
	* Enjoy a lot!!
* Tone:
	* Colloquial and closer but speaking about serious topics.
	* Studio recording
	* Initially a 2 co-hosts but my partner couldn't find time last couple of months
	* After a couple of individual episodes I saw I couldn't get my vision of "growing" (and sometimes "Teaching") so I switched to an "interview" program
* Periodicty:
	* Every two weeks
* Program structure:
	* Sentence
	* Mention one of my projects
	* Self promotion / What are you doing for me and my guest
	* Joomla! News
	* Joomla VEL
	* Main Topic
	* Episode Project
	* Feedback
	* Farewell and CTA (usually ask for comments and reviews)
* Think a list of possible topics for your podcast:
	* To be honest we did not do this.
