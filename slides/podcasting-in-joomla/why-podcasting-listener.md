## Why podcasting? - A listener story

Note:
* I'm a podcast listener since 2004 (kind of). I've always loved radio and it offered me the possibility of listening to lots of Radio Programmes
* As a listener they are really convenient:
	* Lots of content to choose from
	* Podcasters are people really close to you
	* You really can decide what you hear
	* You can easily listen to a podcast while driving, working in non-brainy tasks, running, working out...
