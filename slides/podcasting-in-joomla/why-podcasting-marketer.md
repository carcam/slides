* Listeners really engage with podcasters and "love" them. In fact little communities grow around podcasting
* It's easier and cheaper to produce a high quality audio than a high quality video
* It's a multiplatform medium. People can:
	* Listen the audio with a podcatcher
	* Read shownotes
	* Listen the audio on YouTube
