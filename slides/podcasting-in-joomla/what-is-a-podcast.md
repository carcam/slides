## What's a podcast

Note:
* It's a little audio that you can download and listen on demand
* It's usually created by podcasters in their own studio (although some radio shows offer their programs as podcasts as well)
* At the beginning the RSS Feed was what defined a podcast. Right now platforms like Spreaker, ivoox or even Spotify are trying to change that
