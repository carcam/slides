## Accesibility for your podcast

Note:
* A podcast is just for people who can hear, right?
* Wrong!! You are creating content and it will be amazing if you could make it available to everyone (not just listeners).
* Besides following accesibility Guidelines in your podcast website you should take a couple of things into account:
	* Try to offer a transcript for your podcast:
		* Google Docs and a microphone
		* other services
	* Offer a detailed episode article so that people who cannot hear can read at least what you spoke about, also this will help with your SEO and event your audience will be grateful as they can read the notes before deciding to hear the episode.
